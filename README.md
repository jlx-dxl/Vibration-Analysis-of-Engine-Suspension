# Vibration Analysis of Engine Suspension
 In engineering design, simplified models are often used to analyze the vibration generated when the engine is running. The origin of the OXYZ coordinate system is the center of mass of the engine (centroid), the positive direction of the X-axis points to the opposite direction of the driving direction of the car, and the positive direction of the Z-axis is perpendicular to the ground upward; the engine is regarded as a rigid body with continuous mass distribution, and its vibration has 6 degrees of freedom , are the translation along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis and the rotation around the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis respectively. The positive direction of the vibration displacement is shown by the red dotted line in the figure. Each suspension can be regarded as three spring-damper elements along the coordinate axis, one end acts on the same position of the engine, and the other end is fixedly connected with the subframe. Generally, the vibration of the subframe is not considered.
